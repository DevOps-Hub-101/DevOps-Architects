# DevOps Architecture

## Version Control System
- GitHub Repository
  - Source Code (Java, Python, etc.)
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts (Terraform, CloudFormation)
  - Documentation (Markdown, Wiki)

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- CI/CD Server
  - Jenkins or GitHub Actions
- Build and Test
  - Unit tests (JUnit, pytest)
  - Integration tests (Postman, Selenium)
  - Code quality checks (SonarQube)

## Infrastructure Orchestration
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  - Terraform
  - CloudFormation
- Versioned Infrastructure Code
  - Git (GitFlow branching strategy)
- Provisioning and Scaling
  - Automated provisioning of cloud resources (AWS, Azure)

## Containerization and Orchestration
- Docker Containers
  - Containerization of applications
- Kubernetes Cluster
  - Orchestration and management of containers
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Service Discovery (Kubernetes DNS)

## Monitoring and Observability
- Monitoring Tools
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for visualization
- Log Aggregation
  - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
  - New Relic for end-to-end performance insights

## Collaboration and Communication
- ChatOps
  - Slack or Microsoft Teams integration
- Documentation
  - Confluence or Markdown-based documentation
- Version Control for Documentation
  - Git for documentation versioning

## Security and Compliance
- Automated Security Scanning
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with SonarQube
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP
- Compliance Checks
  - Automated compliance checks for regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)

## Release Management
- Release Pipelines
  - Staging environment for testing
  - Production environment for deployment
- Feature Flags
  - Controlled feature releases using LaunchDarkly
- Blue-Green Deployments
  - Zero-downtime releases using multiple environments

## Disaster Recovery
- Backup and Restore Strategies
  - Regular automated backups of databases and data
- Redundancy and Failover
  - Multi-Availability Zone deployment for high availability

## Cost Optimization
- Resource Monitoring
  - CloudWatch for AWS cost monitoring
- Auto-scaling Policies
  - Automated scaling based on resource utilization
- Right Sizing
  - Continuous evaluation and adjustment of resource sizes

## Workflow Automation
- Workflow Management
  - Apache Airflow for orchestrating workflows
- Git Hooks
  - Pre-commit and post-commit hooks for automated tasks

## Continuous Learning
- Knowledge Sharing
  - Regular team knowledge-sharing sessions
- Post-Incident Reviews
  - Learning from incidents using blameless postmortems
